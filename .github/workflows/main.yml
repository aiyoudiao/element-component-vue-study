# events but only for the master branch

  push:
    branches: [next]
  pull_request:
    branches: [next]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  Lint:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
